maxsum-cpp
==========

Implementation of the Max-Sum Algorithm in C++

The API documentation for this library can be viewed online <a href="http://lteacy.github.com/maxsum-cpp/index.html">here</a>.

Dependencies
============
This project currently has two third party library dependencies:

1. Eigen3: <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org">http://eigen.tuxfamily.org</a>; and

2. Boost 1.48 or later: <a href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a>.

doxygen is required to compile documentation in html. In addition, LaTeX is required to generate forumla's included in the html, and to generate a pdf version of the documentation.

Installation
============
Install CMake (see http://www.cmake.org/) and follow the general instructions for building CMake projects for your platform.
For example, on most unix-like platforms (including Mac OS X) it is usually sufficient to run the following commands:

    cd maxsum-cpp
    cmake .
    make

Optionally, to run unit tests:

    ctest .

And to build documentation:

    make doc

If your platform has multiple cores, both make and ctest can run in parallel, by specifying the number of cores on the command line.
For example, on a 4 core machine, run:

    make -j 4
    ctest -j 4

Known Issues
============
This library is not complete yet!! The initial phase of development is still underway, so there is nothing worthing linking to just yet.
